# 0x01. ES6 Promises
This is our second specialization project under Backend JavaScript, I learnt about Promises and how usefull they were in asynchronous operations. How they represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and allow you to write asynchronous code in a more readable and manageable way.
